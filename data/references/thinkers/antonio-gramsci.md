# Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937)

Italian Marxist philosopher, journalist, and politician. Gramsci co-founded the Communist Party of Italy in 1921 and served as its leader before being imprisoned by Mussolini's fascist regime in 1926. During his eleven years in prison he wrote the *Prison Notebooks*, a sprawling collection of essays that introduced some of the most influential concepts in 20th-century Marxism: cultural hegemony (how ruling classes maintain power through consent rather than force alone), the organic intellectual, the war of position versus war of maneuver, and the analysis of civil society as a site of political struggle. His work has profoundly shaped cultural studies, political theory, and post-colonial thought. He died shortly after his release from prison.

## Key Works

### *Selections from the Prison Notebooks* (written 1929–1935, published posthumously 1948–1951)

Gramsci's notebooks develop the theory of cultural hegemony — how ruling classes maintain power not primarily through coercion but through consent, by making their worldview appear as common sense throughout civil society. He analyzes the roles of media, education, religion, and intellectuals in constructing and sustaining this consent. This is arguably the single most important theoretical framework for analyzing how news media reproduce dominant ideology while appearing neutral and objective.

### "Americanism and Fordism" (1934, from the Prison Notebooks)

This essay analyzes how industrial capitalism under Fordism reshapes not just production but workers' bodies, sexuality, morality, and culture to serve the needs of capital accumulation. Gramsci shows how what appears as cultural modernization is in fact a reorganization of life around the imperatives of production. For media critique, it demonstrates how economic transformations are accompanied by ideological projects that present capitalist rationalization as progress.

### "Some Aspects of the Southern Question" (1926)

An unfinished essay analyzing the class alliances and ideological structures that maintained the Italian South's subordination to Northern industrial capital. Gramsci examines how intellectuals, the church, and cultural narratives function to prevent solidarity between Northern workers and Southern peasants. The essay models how regional, cultural, and racial divisions are constructed and maintained through ideology to prevent unified working-class action — a pattern visible in media framing of geographic and cultural divides.
