# Daniel DeLeon (1852–1914)

American socialist theoretician born in Curaçao. DeLeon led the Socialist Labor Party of America and helped establish the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). He developed a distinctive synthesis of Marxism and industrial unionism, arguing that socialist transformation required both political action through a revolutionary party and economic organization through industrial unions. His vision of a post-capitalist society was structured around industrial union councils rather than a parliamentary state. Key works include *Reform or Revolution* (1896) and *Socialist Reconstruction of Society* (1905).

## Key Works

### *Reform or Revolution* (1896)

DeLeon argues that attempts to reform capitalism through legislation inevitably fail because the state is an instrument of class rule, and that genuine social transformation requires the independent organization of the working class outside of bourgeois political institutions. For media critique, this work provides a framework for analyzing how reform narratives in news coverage channel discontent into institutional channels that preserve existing power relations.

### *Two Pages from Roman History* (1903)

Using analogies from Roman history — the patrician-plebeian struggle and the rise of labor bureaucracies — DeLeon analyzes how ruling classes co-opt popular movements by absorbing their leaders into existing power structures. For media analysis, this work illuminates how news coverage celebrates "responsible" labor leaders and institutional advocacy while marginalizing rank-and-file militancy, reflecting the mechanism by which movements are domesticated.

### *Socialist Reconstruction of Society* (1905)

DeLeon outlines a vision of post-capitalist society organized through industrial union councils, arguing that the economic organization of workers — not the political state — must be the basis of a socialist order. For media critique, the work's analysis of how political institutions serve as covers for economic power applies to understanding how news coverage focuses on electoral politics and legislative procedure while ignoring the underlying economic structures that constrain all political action.
