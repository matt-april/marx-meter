# George Padmore (1903–1959)

Trinidadian journalist, activist, and Pan-Africanist theorist born Malcolm Nurse. Padmore was a leading figure in the Communist International's work on racial and colonial questions in the early 1930s, heading the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers. He broke with the Comintern in 1933 when Soviet foreign policy shifted toward alliances with colonial powers, and thereafter devoted himself to Pan-African organizing independent of Moscow. He was a key organizer of the 1945 Manchester Pan-African Congress and became an advisor to Kwame Nkrumah in newly independent Ghana. His major works include *How Britain Rules Africa* (1936) and *Pan-Africanism or Communism?* (1956). He connected Marxist anti-imperialism with the concrete struggles for African independence.

## Key Works

### *How Britain Rules Africa* (1936)

A detailed exposé of British colonial administration in Africa, documenting how economic exploitation — extraction of raw materials, forced labor, land seizure — was maintained through political structures, racial ideology, and the suppression of African self-organization. For media critique, this work reveals the mechanisms by which imperial power was justified in public discourse through narratives of civilization, development, and trusteeship — framing patterns that persist in contemporary coverage of African economies and international development.

### *Pan-Africanism or Communism?* (1956)

Padmore traces the history of the Pan-African movement and argues that African liberation required an independent political path, distinct from both Western capitalism and Soviet communism. He analyzes how both Cold War blocs used African independence movements as pawns in their geopolitical competition. For media analysis, this work demonstrates how coverage of the Global South is framed through the strategic interests of major powers rather than through the class interests and self-determination of the people involved.

### *The Life and Struggles of Negro Toilers* (1931)

Written for the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, this work surveys the conditions of Black workers across Africa, the Caribbean, and the Americas, connecting racial oppression to capitalist exploitation on a global scale. Padmore shows how racial ideology functions as a tool of class rule, dividing workers along color lines to prevent solidarity. For media critique, this analysis reveals how racial framing in news coverage serves to obscure the common class interests of workers across racial lines.
