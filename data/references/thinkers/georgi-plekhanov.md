# Georgi Plekhanov (1856–1918)

Russian revolutionary and theorist, widely regarded as the father of Russian Marxism. Plekhanov co-founded the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and was instrumental in introducing Marxist ideas to the Russian revolutionary movement. He argued that Russia needed to pass through a stage of capitalist development before socialism was possible — a position that placed him with the Mensheviks after the 1903 party split. His philosophical writings, including *The Development of the Monist View of History* (1895), defended historical materialism against populist and idealist currents. He opposed the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917.

## Key Works

### *The Development of the Monist View of History* (1895)

Plekhanov's major philosophical work defends historical materialism against populist and idealist currents, systematically arguing that social consciousness is determined by social being — that ideas, including political and cultural ones, arise from material conditions rather than the reverse. For media critique, this work provides the theoretical basis for analyzing news narratives not as neutral descriptions of reality but as products of specific material and class conditions.

### *The Role of the Individual in History* (1898)

Plekhanov argues that while individuals can influence the timing and form of historical events, they cannot alter the direction determined by underlying economic and social forces. He critiques "great man" theories of history that attribute social change to exceptional individuals. For media analysis, this work challenges the pervasive media tendency to frame political and economic events through the decisions of individual leaders, CEOs, and public figures rather than through the structural forces that constrain and enable their actions.

### *Art and Social Life* (1912)

Plekhanov examines the relationship between artistic production and social conditions, arguing that art both reflects and reinforces the values of the class that produces it. He critiques "art for art's sake" as an ideology that serves bourgeois interests by severing cultural production from social critique. For media analysis, this framework extends to journalistic style and editorial choices — showing how aesthetic and professional norms in media can function as ideology by presenting class-specific perspectives as universal standards of quality and objectivity.
