# Hal Draper (1914–1990)

American socialist writer, librarian, and activist. Draper was a central figure in the independent socialist tradition in the United States. He was active in the Trotskyist movement in the 1930s–40s and later broke with organized Trotskyism to advocate "socialism from below" — a democratic, anti-Stalinist Marxism rooted in workers' self-emancipation rather than substitutionist vanguardism. His influential pamphlet *The Two Souls of Socialism* (1966) distinguished between authoritarian socialism imposed from above and emancipatory socialism built from below. His major scholarly achievement is the multi-volume *Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution* (1977–1990), a comprehensive study of Marx's political thought. He was also a key figure in the Berkeley Free Speech Movement.

## Key Works

### *The Two Souls of Socialism* (1966)

Draper distinguishes between "socialism from above" — imposed by elites, bureaucrats, or vanguard parties — and "socialism from below" — built through workers' self-emancipation and democratic self-organization. He traces this divide through the entire history of socialist thought. For media critique, this framework reveals how coverage of left-wing politics often conflates these fundamentally different traditions, and how narratives about "socialism" typically reference top-down state control while ignoring the democratic, emancipatory tradition.

### *Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume I: State and Bureaucracy* (1977)

The first volume of Draper's five-volume study reconstructs Marx's analysis of the state as an instrument of class rule, examining how state bureaucracies develop their own interests while serving the broader function of maintaining capitalist social relations. For media analysis, this work provides a detailed framework for understanding how government institutions, regulatory agencies, and political processes presented as neutral in news coverage actually function to protect specific class interests.

### "Who's Going to Be the Lesser Evil in 1968?" (1967)

Draper critiques the doctrine of "lesser evil" voting, arguing that it functions as an ideological trap that keeps working-class politics permanently subordinated to one faction of the ruling class. He analyzes how this logic is reproduced every election cycle to foreclose independent political action. For media critique, this essay is directly applicable to analyzing how election coverage constructs binary political choices, marginalizes alternatives to the two-party framework, and frames any departure from lesser-evil logic as irresponsible or naive.
