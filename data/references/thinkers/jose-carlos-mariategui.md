# José Carlos Mariátegui (1894–1930)

Peruvian journalist, political philosopher, and founder of the Peruvian Socialist Party (later Communist Party). Mariátegui is the most important Marxist thinker to emerge from Latin America. His masterwork, *Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality* (1928), applied Marxist analysis to Peruvian conditions — particularly the land question and the situation of indigenous peoples — while insisting that Latin American socialism could not be a copy of European models but must be a "heroic creation." He argued that indigenous communal traditions (the ayllu) could serve as a foundation for socialist construction. He founded the journal *Amauta* and the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers before his early death at age 35.

## Key Works

### *Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality* (1928)

Mariátegui's masterwork applies Marxist analysis to Peruvian economic, social, and cultural conditions, covering land ownership, indigenous peoples, education, religion, and literature. He insists that Marxist analysis must engage with local conditions rather than mechanically importing European categories. For media critique, this work models how to analyze ideological claims — about development, progress, modernization — by grounding them in the specific class structures and property relations of a given society rather than accepting universal abstractions.

### *La escena contemporánea* (*The Contemporary Scene*, 1925)

A collection of essays analyzing the major political and cultural currents of the post-World War I world, including fascism, the Russian Revolution, and anti-colonial movements. Mariátegui reads international events through the lens of class forces, showing how the same global economic pressures produce different political formations in different national contexts. For media analysis, this work demonstrates how to connect local news events to the global dynamics of capitalism and imperialism rather than treating them as isolated national stories.

### *Defensa del marxismo* (*In Defense of Marxism*, written 1928–1929, published posthumously 1934)

Mariátegui defends Marxism against revisionist critics who argued it was outdated or too rigid, insisting on its continued relevance as a method of social analysis while rejecting dogmatic applications. He argues that Marxism must be a "heroic creation," adapted to each society's specific conditions. For media critique, this work addresses how critical analytical frameworks are dismissed or co-opted, and insists on the continued necessity of class analysis even when dominant culture declares it obsolete.
