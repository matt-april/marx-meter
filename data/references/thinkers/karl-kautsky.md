# Karl Kautsky (1854–1938)

Czech-Austrian Marxist theoretician and a leading figure in the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Second International. Kautsky edited the SPD's theoretical journal *Die Neue Zeit* for over three decades and was considered the foremost interpreter of Marx's ideas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He drafted the Erfurt Program (1891), the SPD's foundational Marxist platform. During and after World War I he moved toward pacifism and opposed both the war and the Bolshevik Revolution, drawing sharp criticism from Lenin in *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*. Key works include *The Agrarian Question* (1899) and *The Dictatorship of the Proletariat* (1918).

## Key Works

### *The Class Struggle (Erfurt Program)* (1892)

Kautsky's commentary on the SPD's Erfurt Program provides an accessible, systematic exposition of Marxist class analysis — how capitalist development concentrates wealth, proletarianizes the middle classes, and intensifies the antagonism between labor and capital. For media critique, this work offers a foundational framework for identifying how news coverage maps onto class positions: whose interests are served by a given policy narrative, and which class perspectives are presented as universal common sense.

### *The Agrarian Question* (1899)

A detailed Marxist analysis of agriculture under capitalism, examining how land ownership, commodity markets, and credit systems transform farming from subsistence into an arena of class exploitation. Kautsky shows how small farmers are simultaneously exploited and ideologically conscripted to support property relations against their own interests. For media analysis, this work reveals how coverage of agricultural policy, rural life, and land use obscures the class dynamics of land ownership.

### *The Road to Power* (1909)

Kautsky analyzes how the development of capitalism itself creates the conditions for social transformation — through the concentration of industry, the growth of the proletariat, and the sharpening of class contradictions. He argues that the ruling class uses the state, militarism, and colonial expansion to delay this process. For media critique, the work provides a framework for understanding how narratives of economic growth, national defense, and global competitiveness function to justify policies that serve capital accumulation while presenting them as serving the general welfare.
