# Karl Korsch (1886–1961)

German Marxist theorist and one of the founders of Western Marxism alongside Lukács and Gramsci. His major work *Marxism and Philosophy* (1923) argued that Marxism itself must be understood dialectically and historically — that is, applied to itself as a theory embedded in social conditions, rather than treated as a fixed doctrine. This earned condemnation from both the Comintern and the SPD. Korsch was a left communist critical of both Soviet orthodoxy and Social Democratic reformism. He served briefly as Minister of Justice in Thuringia (1923) and later emigrated to the United States after the Nazi rise to power. His work influenced the Frankfurt School and later the New Left.

## Key Works

### *Marxism and Philosophy* (1923)

Korsch argues that Marxism must be understood as a historically situated theory, not a timeless doctrine — and that it must apply its own method of ideology critique to itself. He demonstrates that the separation of "theory" from "practice" and of "philosophy" from "politics" is itself an ideological operation that serves to neutralize radical thought. For media critique, this work insists that no framework for analyzing ideology — including Marxism — is exempt from historical and class determination, and that ideas must always be understood in relation to the material interests they serve.

### *Karl Marx* (1938)

A concise restatement of Marx's core method and political economy, written for a broad audience during Korsch's American exile. The work emphasizes Marx's approach as a critical method of social analysis rather than a fixed set of conclusions. For media analysis, it provides an accessible introduction to the Marxist method of tracing ideological claims back to material interests and class positions — the fundamental operation of ideology critique applied to news coverage.

### *Three Essays on Marxism* (1971, posthumous collection)

These essays, written across Korsch's career, address the crisis of Marxism as a living theory and its relationship to changing social conditions. Korsch examines how revolutionary theory can become ossified into ideology that legitimates existing power rather than challenging it. For media critique, this analysis of how critical frameworks can be co-opted — turned from tools of liberation into instruments of domination — applies to understanding how concepts like "democracy," "freedom," and "reform" function in news coverage.
