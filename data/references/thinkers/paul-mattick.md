# Paul Mattick (1904–1981)

German-American Marxist theorist and the foremost proponent of council communism. Born in Berlin, Mattick was active in radical politics from his youth, participating in the German workers' council movement after World War I. He emigrated to the United States in 1926 and became a leading voice for anti-Leninist, anti-Stalinist Marxism, arguing that workers' councils — not parties or trade unions — were the authentic form of proletarian self-organization. His major theoretical work, *Marx and Keynes* (1969), critiqued Keynesian economics from a Marxist perspective, arguing that state intervention cannot resolve capitalism's fundamental crisis tendencies. Other key works include *Anti-Bolshevik Communism* (1978). He insisted on the continued relevance of Marx's crisis theory throughout the postwar boom.

## Key Works

### *Marx and Keynes: The Limits of the Mixed Economy* (1969)

Mattick argues that Keynesian economics — government deficit spending to manage demand — cannot resolve capitalism's fundamental crisis tendencies but only postpones them, and that Keynesian ideology serves to legitimize state intervention on behalf of capital while presenting it as serving the general welfare. For media critique, this work provides a framework for analyzing how economic coverage treats Keynesian stimulus, government spending, and fiscal policy as neutral technical management rather than as class-interested interventions that redistribute resources.

### *Economic Crisis and Crisis Theory* (1974)

Mattick defends Marx's theory of the falling rate of profit as the fundamental driver of capitalist crises, against both Keynesian and underconsumptionist alternatives. He argues that economic crises are inherent to capitalism, not the result of policy mistakes or external shocks. For media analysis, this work challenges the dominant framing of recessions and economic downturns in news coverage, which typically attributes crises to bad actors, poor regulation, or unforeseen events rather than to the structural contradictions of the capitalist system itself.

### *Anti-Bolshevik Communism* (1978)

A collection of essays on the council communist tradition — the movement that argued for workers' councils against both parliamentary reformism and Leninist party organization. Mattick analyzes how both Social Democratic and Bolshevik models of socialism substituted elite management for workers' self-organization. For media critique, this work challenges the binary framing — capitalism versus authoritarian state control — that dominates media discussion of economic systems, revealing an entire tradition of democratic worker self-management that is systematically excluded from mainstream discourse.
