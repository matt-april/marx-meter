# Alexandra Kollontai (1872–1952)

Russian Bolshevik revolutionary, feminist theorist, and diplomat. Kollontai was the first woman to serve as a government minister in modern history (People's Commissar for Social Welfare, 1917) and later became the world's first female ambassador. She wrote extensively on the relationship between socialism, sexuality, and women's liberation, arguing that the revolution must transform personal and domestic life as well as economic relations. Key works include *The Social Basis of the Woman Question* (1909) and *The Workers' Opposition* (1921), the latter a critique of bureaucratic centralization within the Bolshevik Party. She was sidelined into diplomatic posts but survived the purges.

## Key Works

### *The Social Basis of the Woman Question* (1909)

Kollontai argues that women's oppression is rooted in economic dependence and capitalist property relations, not in biology or timeless patriarchy. She critiques bourgeois feminism for pursuing legal equality without challenging the class system that produces gendered exploitation. For media critique, this work provides a framework for analyzing how coverage of gender issues separates feminist concerns from class analysis, obscuring how women's oppression serves the interests of capital.

### *The Workers' Opposition* (1921)

A critique of bureaucratic centralization within the Bolshevik Party, this pamphlet argues that the revolution was being captured by a managerial stratum that substituted its own interests for those of the working class. Kollontai's analysis of how institutions claiming to serve workers can develop independent class interests and corresponding self-justifying narratives applies directly to analyzing how any institution — including media organizations — can diverge from its stated public mission.

### *The New Morality and the Working Class* (1918)

Kollontai examines how bourgeois sexual morality, family structures, and emotional norms function as ideology — shaping personal life to serve capitalist accumulation by maintaining the nuclear family as an economic unit. For media analysis, this work reveals how coverage of family, relationships, and personal life reproduces class-serving assumptions about how people should live, presenting historically specific arrangements as natural or morally necessary.
