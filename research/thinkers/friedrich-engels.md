# Friedrich Engels (1820–1895)

German industrialist, philosopher, and co-author with Marx of the foundational texts of Marxism. Engels's early work *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1845) drew on firsthand observation of Manchester factory life. He co-wrote *The Communist Manifesto* and *The German Ideology* with Marx, and after Marx's death edited and published Volumes II and III of *Capital*. His independent contributions include *Anti-Dühring* (1878), *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State* (1884), and *Dialectics of Nature*. Engels also financially supported Marx for decades, enabling much of Marx's research.

## Key Works

### *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1845)

Based on firsthand observation of Manchester's industrial slums, this work pioneered the empirical investigation of how capitalist exploitation affects workers' lives while remaining invisible in official discourse. Engels documents how bourgeois society systematically ignores or misrepresents working-class suffering. For media critique, it models how to look beneath surface narratives to the material conditions they obscure or normalize.

### *Anti-Dühring* (1878)

A comprehensive polemical exposition of Marxist philosophy, political economy, and socialism, written against Eugen Dühring's rival system. The work provides accessible explanations of historical materialism, the labor theory of value, and dialectical method. Its section on "force theory" — debunking the idea that political power rather than economic relations drives history — is particularly useful for analyzing media narratives that attribute social outcomes to individual actors or policy choices rather than structural forces.

### *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State* (1884)

Drawing on Lewis Henry Morgan's anthropological research, Engels argues that the patriarchal family, private property, and the state arose together as instruments for preserving class rule. The work demonstrates how institutions presented as natural or eternal are in fact historical products of specific economic relations. This analysis is directly applicable to media coverage that treats property relations, gender roles, or state authority as timeless rather than serving particular class interests.
