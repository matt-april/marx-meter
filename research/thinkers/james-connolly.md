# James Connolly (1868–1916)

Irish-Scottish Marxist, labor organizer, and revolutionary. Connolly founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party in 1896, arguing that national liberation and socialist revolution in Ireland were inseparable. He organized workers in both Ireland and the United States, co-founded the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and led the Irish Citizen Army. His major written work, *Labour in Irish History* (1910), analyzed Irish history through the lens of class struggle. He was one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and was executed by British firing squad, becoming a martyr to both the Irish republican and socialist movements.

## Key Works

### *Labour in Irish History* (1910)

Connolly reinterprets Irish history through the lens of class struggle, arguing that the standard nationalist narrative — which frames Irish history as a story of national resistance to English tyranny — obscures the class conflicts within Ireland itself. He shows how Irish ruling classes collaborated with British imperialism against their own working class. For media critique, this work models how nationalist framing in news coverage can obscure class interests, and how the "national interest" is typically the interest of the owning class.

### *The Re-Conquest of Ireland* (1915)

A companion volume to *Labour in Irish History*, this work analyzes how British capital controlled Ireland through economic domination — ownership of land, industry, and transport — and how this economic control shaped political, cultural, and intellectual life. For media analysis, the work demonstrates how economic ownership translates into ideological power, and how control of material resources determines whose version of events is treated as legitimate.

### *Labour, Nationality and Religion* (1910)

A reply to a Jesuit priest who attacked socialism, this work analyzes how religious institutions function as ideological supports for the propertied classes, lending moral authority to existing economic arrangements. Connolly shows how the church's claim to stand above class conflict in fact serves to preserve the status quo. For media critique, this analysis applies to any institution — including the press — that claims neutrality or objectivity while systematically favoring the interests of property.
