# Leon Trotsky (1879–1940)

Russian-Ukrainian Marxist revolutionary, theorist, and leader of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Trotsky developed the theory of permanent revolution, arguing that in underdeveloped countries the bourgeois-democratic and socialist revolutions would merge into a continuous process. He played a central role in both the 1905 and 1917 revolutions. After Lenin's death, he lost the power struggle against Stalin and was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1929. In exile he wrote *The Revolution Betrayed* (1936), a Marxist analysis of Stalinist degeneration, and founded the Fourth International (1938). He was assassinated in Mexico City by a Soviet agent in 1940.

## Key Works

### *Literature and Revolution* (1924)

Trotsky examines the relationship between art, culture, and class society, arguing that literature and culture both reflect and shape the class forces of their era. He analyzes how artistic movements carry ideological content and how a revolutionary society would transform cultural production. For media critique, this work provides tools for reading cultural output — including journalism — as expressing class positions, and for understanding how aesthetic choices encode political assumptions.

### *The Revolution Betrayed* (1936)

A Marxist analysis of how the Soviet Union degenerated from a workers' state into a bureaucratic dictatorship, this work examines how a ruling bureaucracy develops its own material interests and corresponding ideology while claiming to represent the working class. Trotsky's analysis of how institutions distort their stated missions to serve the interests of those who control them applies directly to analyzing how media organizations, governments, and NGOs operate in ways that diverge from their public-interest rhetoric.

### *The History of the Russian Revolution* (1930)

A sweeping narrative of the 1917 revolution that demonstrates how class forces, economic conditions, and institutional structures shape political events, while also analyzing the role of political consciousness and leadership. Trotsky examines how different classes understood and narrated the same events differently based on their material interests. This approach to reading historical events through competing class narratives is directly applicable to analyzing how the same news events are framed differently depending on class perspective.
