# M. N. Roy (1887–1954)

Indian revolutionary, political theorist, and radical humanist born Narendra Nath Bhattacharya. Roy's revolutionary career spanned continents: he sought arms for Indian independence from Germany during WWI, helped found the Communist Party of Mexico (1919), and became a prominent figure in the Communist International, where he debated Lenin on the colonial question. He founded the Communist Party of India (in exile, 1920) and served on the Comintern's executive committee. After breaking with the Comintern in the 1930s, he developed his own philosophy of radical humanism, departing from orthodox Marxism toward a humanist materialism that emphasized individual freedom. Key works include *India in Transition* (1922) and *Reason, Romanticism and Revolution* (1952).

## Key Works

### *India in Transition* (1922)

Roy provides a class analysis of Indian society and the independence movement, arguing that the Indian bourgeoisie — represented by the Congress Party — sought national independence primarily to capture the domestic market for itself, not to liberate the masses. For media critique, this work demonstrates how nationalist movements and their media coverage can serve the class interests of a domestic bourgeoisie while presenting those interests as the interests of the entire nation.

### *Revolution and Counter-Revolution in China* (1946)

Drawing on the failed Chinese Revolution of 1925–27, Roy analyzes how the national bourgeoisie and imperialism collaborated to crush the working-class movement, and how political alliances based on nationalist rather than class solidarity led to catastrophe. For media analysis, this work reveals how narratives of "national unity" and cross-class political alliances function to subordinate working-class interests to those of capital — a pattern visible in media coverage of coalition politics and national crises.

### *Reason, Romanticism and Revolution* (1952)

Roy's philosophical magnum opus traces the development of rationalist and irrationalist currents in Western thought, arguing that the retreat from Enlightenment reason into romanticism and irrationalism served the interests of classes threatened by rational social analysis. For media critique, this work provides a framework for understanding how anti-rationalist tendencies in public discourse — appeals to tradition, emotion, national myth, and cultural identity — function to foreclose materialist analysis of class interests.
