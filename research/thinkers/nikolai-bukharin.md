# Nikolai Bukharin (1888–1938)

Russian Bolshevik revolutionary, economist, and theoretician. Bukharin was one of the youngest and most intellectually prolific members of the Bolshevik old guard. After the revolution he edited *Pravda* and wrote influential theoretical works including *The Economics of the Transition Period* (1920), *Historical Materialism* (1921), and *Imperialism and World Economy* (1917). In the 1920s he championed the New Economic Policy and a gradualist approach to building socialism, allying with Stalin against Trotsky before himself falling out of favor. He was a principal architect of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. He was arrested during the Great Purge and executed in 1938 after a show trial.

## Key Works

### *Imperialism and World Economy* (1917)

Written before Lenin's more famous pamphlet on the same subject, Bukharin's work analyzes how capitalism organized itself into competing national blocs of finance capital, leading inevitably to imperialist war. He shows how the internationalization of capital coexists with intensified national rivalry. For media critique, this framework reveals how news coverage of international trade, sanctions, and military alliances reflects underlying competition between national capitals rather than the idealistic motivations usually invoked.

### *Historical Materialism: A System of Sociology* (1921)

A systematic textbook of Marxist social theory that covers the relationship between economic base and ideological superstructure, the role of technology, classes, the state, and — critically — the function of ideology, art, and philosophy in maintaining social equilibrium. Bukharin's detailed treatment of how superstructural institutions reproduce existing class relations provides an accessible theoretical foundation for analyzing the ideological function of media as a social institution.

### *The Economics of the Transition Period* (1920)

Bukharin analyzes the economic and social disruption that accompanies the breakdown of capitalist order and the construction of a new society, examining how old economic structures, class relations, and ideologies persist and resist transformation. For media analysis, this work is useful for understanding how periods of economic crisis generate competing narratives about the causes and solutions — and how established institutions frame disruption to preserve existing power relations.
