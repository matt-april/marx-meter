# Paul Lafargue (1841–1911)

French revolutionary socialist of Cuban-Creole descent, married to Laura Marx (Karl Marx's daughter). Lafargue participated in the Paris Commune of 1871 and was a founding member of the French Workers' Party. He is best known for *The Right to Be Lazy* (1883), a satirical polemic against the work ethic that argued the proletariat's demand should be for less labor, not more. He also wrote on economic determinism, religion, and the origins of abstract ideas. He and Laura died together in a joint suicide in 1911.

## Key Works

### *The Right to Be Lazy* (1883)

A satirical polemic against the bourgeois cult of work, Lafargue argues that the proletariat's internalization of the work ethic is itself a form of ideological domination — that workers have been taught to love the very thing that exploits them. For media critique, this work exposes how productivity narratives, "hustle culture" framing, and moral condemnation of idleness in news coverage serve the interests of capital by naturalizing overwork as a virtue rather than a condition of exploitation.

### *The Religion of Capital* (1887)

A satirical catechism in which Lafargue parodies religious forms to show how capitalism functions as a secular religion, complete with its own dogmas, saints, and moral commandments. The bourgeois virtues of thrift, industry, and property are revealed as articles of faith that serve class interests. For media analysis, this work anticipates how economic orthodoxies — balanced budgets, free markets, entrepreneurship — are presented in news coverage with the unquestioning reverence of religious doctrine.

### *The Evolution of Property from Savagery to Civilization* (1890)

Lafargue traces the historical development of property forms, demonstrating that private property is not a natural right but a historically specific institution that arose under particular economic conditions and serves particular class interests. For media critique, this framework challenges the assumption — pervasive in news coverage — that existing property relations are natural and inevitable rather than historically contingent arrangements that benefit specific classes.
