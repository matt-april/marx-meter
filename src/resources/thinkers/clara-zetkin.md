# Clara Zetkin (1857–1933)

German Marxist theorist, activist, and a central figure in the international socialist women's movement. Zetkin edited the Social Democratic women's newspaper *Die Gleichheit* (Equality) for 25 years and organized the first International Women's Day in 1911. She was a member of the SPD's left wing, opposed World War I, and later joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Communist International. She served in the Reichstag and used her position to oppose the rise of fascism. Her theoretical contributions focused on the relationship between women's oppression and capitalist exploitation, insisting that women's liberation required socialist transformation.

## Key Works

### "Only in Conjunction with the Proletarian Woman Will Socialism Be Victorious" (1896, speech at the SPD Congress)

Zetkin argues that the "woman question" is fundamentally a class question — that bourgeois women and proletarian women have opposed interests, and that bourgeois feminism's demand for formal legal equality obscures the material exploitation of working-class women. For media critique, this speech provides a framework for analyzing how coverage of gender issues separates feminism from class analysis, presenting women's advancement in professional and political life as universal progress while ignoring how class determines women's actual conditions.

### "The Struggle Against Fascism" (1923, report to the Communist International Executive)

Zetkin analyzes fascism not as an irrational eruption but as a mass movement rooted in the economic crisis of capitalism, one that recruits across classes by offering pseudo-radical solutions that preserve capitalist property relations. She examines how fascist ideology exploits genuine grievances while redirecting them away from the ruling class. For media analysis, this work provides tools for identifying how populist and authoritarian movements are covered — whether media frames them as pathological aberrations or engages with the class dynamics that produce them.

### "Women's Work and the Organization of Trade Unions" (1893, speech)

Zetkin examines how capital uses gender divisions to weaken the working class — employing women at lower wages to undercut male workers, then using male workers' resentment to prevent cross-gender solidarity. For media critique, this analysis reveals how news coverage of labor markets, wage gaps, and workplace policy can frame gender competition as natural rather than as a deliberate strategy of capital to divide workers against each other.
