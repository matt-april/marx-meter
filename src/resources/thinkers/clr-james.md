# C. L. R. James (1901–1989)

Trinidadian historian, journalist, socialist theorist, and cricket writer. James is best known for *The Black Jacobins* (1938), a groundbreaking history of the Haitian Revolution that placed Black self-emancipation at the center of the Age of Revolution. He emphasized the autonomous agency of non-white workers and colonized peoples within Marxist politics, challenging Eurocentric assumptions in the international left. He was active in Trotskyist politics in the United States and Britain, co-authored *State Capitalism and World Revolution* (1950) with Raya Dunayevskaya and Grace Lee Boggs, and wrote influential works on culture including *Beyond a Boundary* (1963), a meditation on cricket, colonialism, and class. His thought bridged Marxism, Pan-Africanism, and Caribbean intellectual traditions.

## Key Works

### *The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution* (1938)

A history of the Haitian Revolution that demonstrates how enslaved people were not passive victims but the driving force of their own liberation, challenging Eurocentric narratives that centered white agency. James reveals how class and racial dynamics intersected with colonial economics to produce revolution. For media critique, the work models how dominant historical narratives systematically erase the agency of oppressed groups — a pattern that persists in news coverage of labor struggles, anti-colonial movements, and racial justice campaigns.

### *American Civilization* (written 1950, published posthumously 1993)

An extended analysis of American popular culture — including film, comics, radio, and mass entertainment — as expressions of both capitalist domination and working-class desire for freedom. James argues that popular culture reveals contradictions that official political discourse suppresses, and that mass audiences are not passive consumers but active interpreters. This is one of the earliest Marxist analyses of mass media and popular culture as sites of ideological struggle, directly applicable to understanding how media simultaneously reproduces and contests dominant ideology.

### *State Capitalism and World Revolution* (1950)

Co-authored with Raya Dunayevskaya and Grace Lee Boggs, this work argues that the Soviet Union represented not socialism but a form of state capitalism, and that bureaucratic management — whether in the USSR, in Western corporations, or in trade unions — constituted a new form of class rule. For media analysis, this framework is useful for identifying how institutional interests shape the output of any organization, including media companies, regardless of their stated mission or political orientation.
