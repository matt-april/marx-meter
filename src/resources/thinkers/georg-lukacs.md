# Georg Lukács (1885–1971)

Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary critic, one of the founders of Western Marxism. His major work *History and Class Consciousness* (1923) reintroduced Hegelian dialectics into Marxist theory and developed the concept of reification — the process by which social relations come to appear as relations between things. The book was condemned by the Comintern and Lukács later disavowed it, though it profoundly influenced the Frankfurt School and subsequent Marxist philosophy. He also made major contributions to Marxist aesthetics and literary theory, championing critical realism over modernism. He briefly served as Minister of Culture during the 1956 Hungarian uprising and was deported to Romania before eventually returning to Budapest.

## Key Works

### *History and Class Consciousness* (1923)

This foundational work of Western Marxism develops the concept of reification — the process by which human social relations come to appear as objective, thing-like properties of commodities and institutions. Lukács argues that bourgeois thought is structurally incapable of grasping social totality because it is embedded in reified categories. For media critique, reification explains how news coverage treats market outcomes, institutional arrangements, and class relations as natural facts rather than as products of human activity that can be changed.

### *The Destruction of Reason* (1952)

Lukács traces the development of irrationalist philosophy in Germany from Schelling through Nietzsche to Nazi ideology, arguing that these intellectual currents served the class interests of a bourgeoisie retreating from Enlightenment rationalism as rational analysis increasingly pointed toward socialist conclusions. For media analysis, this work provides a framework for identifying how appeals to irrationalism, myth, and anti-intellectualism in public discourse serve to deflect materialist criticism of existing power structures.

### *The Historical Novel* (1937)

A study of the historical novel as a literary form, this work analyzes how narrative conventions shape historical consciousness. Lukács argues that the great realist novelists revealed the social forces driving historical change, while later degraded forms of historical fiction reduced history to costume drama or individual psychology. For media critique, the work's method of analyzing how narrative form encodes ideology — how the way a story is told determines what class forces become visible or invisible — is directly transferable to news coverage.
