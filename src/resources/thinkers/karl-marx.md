# Karl Marx (1818–1883)

Co-founder, with Friedrich Engels, of the theoretical framework that bears his name. Born in Trier, Prussia, Marx studied philosophy and law before turning to journalism and political economy. His central project was a systematic critique of capitalism — analyzing how surplus value is extracted from labor, how commodities obscure social relations, and how the contradictions internal to capitalist production drive historical change. Major works include *The Communist Manifesto* (1848, with Engels), *Capital* (Volume I, 1867), *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte* (1852), and the *Grundrisse*. He was active in the International Workingmen's Association (First International) and spent much of his adult life in exile in London.

## Key Works

### *Capital, Volume I* (1867)

Marx's magnum opus analyzes the capitalist mode of production, introducing the concept of commodity fetishism — the process by which social relations between people appear as relations between things. The work reveals how surplus value is extracted from labor and obscured by market mechanisms. For media critique, commodity fetishism provides a foundational framework for understanding how news coverage naturalizes market relations and renders exploitation invisible.

### *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte* (1852)

A political analysis of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's 1851 coup, this work demonstrates how class interests operate behind ideological masks. Marx shows how political actors invoke tradition, rhetoric, and spectacle to disguise the material forces driving events. Its analysis of how ruling classes frame political crises — and how different class fractions align — is directly applicable to decoding media coverage of political events.

### *The German Ideology* (1846, published posthumously 1932)

Co-written with Engels, this work argues that "the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas" — that the class controlling material production also controls mental production. It establishes the base-superstructure model of how economic relations shape law, politics, culture, and ideology. This framework is essential for analyzing whose class interests are embedded in the assumptions, framing, and common sense of news coverage.
