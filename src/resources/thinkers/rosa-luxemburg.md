# Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919)

Polish-German Marxist theorist, economist, and revolutionary. Luxemburg championed the mass strike as a revolutionary instrument, critiqued both reformism and nationalist tendencies within Social Democracy, and opposed World War I from prison. Her major economic work, *The Accumulation of Capital* (1913), argued that capitalism requires continuous expansion into non-capitalist territories. She co-founded the Spartacus League and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). She also wrote a prescient critique of the Bolshevik Revolution, warning against the suppression of democratic freedoms. She was murdered by Freikorps soldiers in January 1919 during the failed Spartacist uprising in Berlin.

## Key Works

### *The Accumulation of Capital* (1913)

Luxemburg's major economic work argues that capitalism cannot sustain itself through internal markets alone and must constantly expand into non-capitalist territories and populations, consuming pre-capitalist economies through militarism and colonialism. This framework is essential for analyzing media narratives about globalization, trade policy, and military intervention, revealing the economic imperatives behind what is often presented as humanitarian concern or modernization.

### *Reform or Revolution* (1899)

A polemic against Eduard Bernstein's evolutionary socialism, this work argues that incremental reforms within capitalism cannot gradually transform it into socialism because capitalist institutions — including the legal system, the state, and the press — actively reproduce class domination. Luxemburg's analysis of how reformist ideology functions to preserve the existing order is directly applicable to identifying media narratives that frame systemic problems as solvable through modest policy adjustments.

### *The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions* (1906)

Drawing on the 1905 Russian Revolution, Luxemburg analyzes how mass strikes arise spontaneously from workers' lived experience of exploitation rather than from party directives. She demonstrates that economic and political struggles are inseparable, and that working-class self-activity generates its own forms of organization and consciousness. For media analysis, this work challenges coverage that treats labor action as orchestrated disruption rather than an organic response to class conditions.
