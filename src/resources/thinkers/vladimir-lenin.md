# Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924)

Russian revolutionary, political theorist, and leader of the Bolshevik Party. Lenin adapted Marxist theory to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, developing concepts of the vanguard party, democratic centralism, and imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He led the October Revolution of 1917, establishing the world's first socialist state, and founded the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919. Major works include *What Is to Be Done?* (1902), *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism* (1917), and *The State and Revolution* (1917). His political legacy remains one of the most debated in modern history, having shaped revolutionary movements worldwide while also establishing patterns of single-party rule.

## Key Works

### *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism* (1917)

Lenin analyzes how capitalism developed into a global system of monopoly, finance capital, and colonial exploitation, arguing that imperialism is not a policy choice but a structural stage of capitalist development. The work explains how surplus profits from colonial extraction fund domestic stability and shape international relations. For media critique, it provides a framework for identifying how news coverage of foreign policy, trade, and international conflict obscures the economic interests driving imperial power.

### *What Is to Be Done?* (1902)

An argument for the role of a revolutionary newspaper and organized political consciousness in working-class politics, this work addresses how spontaneous trade-union consciousness remains within the bounds of bourgeois ideology without deliberate counter-education. Lenin's analysis of how ruling-class ideas dominate through institutional channels — and how an independent press can challenge them — is directly relevant to understanding the ideological function of mainstream media.

### *The State and Revolution* (1917)

Written on the eve of the October Revolution, this work argues that the state is not a neutral arbiter but an instrument of class domination, and that bourgeois democracy functions to manage class conflict in the interests of capital. Lenin's analysis of how state institutions present themselves as serving the general interest while enforcing particular class interests provides a framework for reading media coverage of government, law, and public policy.
