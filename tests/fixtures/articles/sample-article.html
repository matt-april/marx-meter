    <h1>TechCorp Announces Major Restructuring Amid Record Profits</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Jane Reporter | February 10, 2026</p>
    <p>TechCorp announced today a workforce optimization initiative that will result in the elimination of approximately 5,000 positions across its global operations, even as the company reported record quarterly revenue of $48.2 billion.</p>
    <p>"This restructuring positions TechCorp for sustainable long-term growth in the AI era," said CEO Mark Williams in a statement to investors.</p>
    <p>According to Goldman Sachs analyst Jane Smith, the restructuring positions TechCorp for long-term growth. "We see this as a positive signal for shareholders," Smith wrote in a research note.</p>
    <p>Positions were eliminated as part of the strategic review, with the majority of cuts affecting customer support and content moderation teams.</p>
    <p>TechCorp's stock rose 4.2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. The company's market capitalization now exceeds $2 trillion.</p>
    <p>An unnamed administration official said the White House was "monitoring the situation" but declined to comment further on whether any policy response was planned.</p>
    <p>The workforce optimization initiative is expected to save the company approximately $1.2 billion annually, which TechCorp said would be redirected toward artificial intelligence research and development.</p>
